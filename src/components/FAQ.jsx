  {q:'How long does it take to build a website or app?',a:'A simple website takes 1–2 weeks. A web management system or SaaS platform typically takes 4–8 weeks. A mobile app can take 6–12 weeks. We give you a clear timeline during our free initial consultation.'},
  {q:'Do you work with small budgets and startups?',a:"Absolutely. We started from scratch too and understand tight budgets. We offer flexible payment plans. Our Starter package begins from KES 8,000. Let's talk — we'll find a way to work together."},
  {q:'Do you do M-Pesa integration?',a:'Yes! M-Pesa integration (STK Push, C2B, B2C, paybill & till number) is one of our specialties. We handle the full Daraja API setup and testing.'},
  {q:'Who owns the code after the project?',a:'You do. On completion and full payment, all source code, assets, and credentials are handed over to you. No lock-ins, ever.'},
  {q:'What ongoing support do you offer after launch?',a:'All packages include free support (1–6 months depending on plan). After that, affordable monthly retainers for bug fixes, updates, and new features.'},
  {q:'Are you certified IT consultants?',a:'No — and we are upfront about that. We are developers and builders, not certified IT consultants. Any guidance is based on hands-on experience only. For compliance or legal tech decisions, please consult a certified professional.'},
  {q:'Can you work with clients outside Kenya?',a:'Yes! We work with clients anywhere via WhatsApp, email, and video calls. Payments via M-Pesa, bank transfer, or international methods.'},
